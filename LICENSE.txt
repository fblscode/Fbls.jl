No, period. Seriously; I wasn't even invited to the meeting, and I'm supposed to play along with whatever crazy shit they come up with? So we need licenses? To allow the state to help protect our interests? Yeah, right; like the state was ever into the protecting rights of citizens game. Thanks, but no thanks. The fruits of my labor are mine to share in whatever way, shape or fashion I deem appropriate. We need licenses and politics like we need another collective hole in the head. So here it is; go bananas; use it, misuse it; extend it, break it; and please share your experience. It's all part of the grand experiment, and you don't control experiments; controlling is simulating, pretending.
