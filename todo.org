* try one more time to add Col{}() constructor

* end readme with async event io example based on offsidx test
** add custom type/read/writeval
** add tempcol with custom type
*** no read/writeval needed
** keep offs idx in memory
** call writerec directly on tbl
*** add specialization without buf

* remaining issues: 
** how to rename BasicCol to Col?
** how to best add seq support?
** any way to steal the tuple parametric vararg magic?
** any way to get parametric function types?
** better alternative to returning Void from getindex?
** any special vars

* ---

* add trans support
* add HashUnix
** use tuple keys
** base on Dict
* add HashMultix
** base on Dict of Sets
* add sorted idxs
